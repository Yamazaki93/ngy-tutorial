# ngy-tutorial

Ngy-Tutorial is an Angular plugin that gives your app a customizable, user-friendly "getting started" tutorial. 

So you've got your killer UI that's intutive, slick and responsive, but will everyone know how to use it? What about some nice shortcuts or features that you want to highlight? Or maybe some UI changes that you want the users to be aware of? Ngy-Tutorial literally adds a step-by-step "tutorial" to your app so you can highlight your cool UI and give every user a head start.

Check out the Demo!
