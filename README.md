# ngy-tutorial

Ngy-Tutorial is an Angular plugin that gives your Angular app a built-in, customizable, user-friendly, literally "getting started" ðŸ¤“ tutorial.

So you've got your killer UI that's intuitive, slick and responsive, but will everyone know how to use it? What about some nice shortcuts or features that you want to highlight? Or maybe some UI changes that you want the users to be aware of? No one really wants to read through a long readme file, so how about an interactive, in-app tutorial? Ngy-Tutorial literally adds a step-by-step "tutorial" to your app so you can highlight your cool UI and give every user a head start.

Check out the [Demo Site](https://yamazaki93.github.io/ngy-tutorial/ngy-tutorial-app/)!

## Installation

Add the library by using npm with `npm install ngy-tutorial` or yarn with `yarn add ngy-tutorial`

Tested under Angular 6

## Getting Started (even the tutorial needs a tutorial)

1. Install the package with npm or yarn.
2. Add the module to your root module with `NgyTutorialModule.forRoot()` under `imports` in your `app.module.ts`.

    ```typescript
        @NgModule({
        declarations: [
            AppComponent
        ],
        imports: [
            BrowserModule,
            NgyTutorialModule.forRoot()
        ],
        providers: [],
        bootstrap: [AppComponent]
        })
        export class AppModule { }
    ```

3. Place element `<lib-ngy-tutorial></lib-ngy-tutorial>` in your app.
4. You can now inject and use `NgyTutorialService` service to control the tutorial, see the [API](https://yamazaki93.github.io/ngy-tutorial/ngy-tutorial-app/) for available commands and options.

## FAQ and Notes

 - Note, scrolling in the viewing window: The viewing window allows all interaction including scrolling, which means user can scroll the intended element away during the tutorial. Your app should disable scrolling during the tutorial if scrolling is not desired.
 - The tutorial doesnt start? Try calling `NgyTutorialService.showTutorial()` in or after `ngOnInit`.

## Current Limitations & Future Plans

There are currently few limitations of Ngy-Tutorial and some will be improved in the future.

 - Desktop (Large screens) only: Currently it only supports desktop and larger screen tablets. Phone and mobile support is planned. The tutorial might not show correctly when viewed with smaller screen devices.
 - Scrolling support: The tutorial currently is limited to single-view layout tutorials. In the future it is planned to support scrolling to element.
 - Square view window only: Because of the way how "covers" are layed out, the preview window that hightlight an element is square only.
